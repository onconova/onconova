## Installation

Checkout the [Installation Guide](https://onconova.github.io/docs/latest/get-started/installation/) for detailed setup instructions.

If you need help, consult the [FAQ](https://onconova.github.io/docs/latest/faq/) or [open an issue](https://github.com/luisfabib/onconova/issues).

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

### Development Setup

Follow the [Installation Guide](https://onconova.github.io/docs/latest)/get-started/installation.md) to set up Onconova for local development using Docker Compose.

Use the `compose.dev.yml` file for development. You can specify it directly when starting the containers:
```sh
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```

The development containers are configured to mount your local source code into the container. Any changes you make to your code are immediately reflected inside the container, automatically restarting the server or client as needed. This enables live development without requiring you to install all dependencies on your local machine.

### Testing

Onconova includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure all components function as intended. The testing strategy varies depending on whether you are working on the server, the client, or both.

Run server-side unit tests using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) within the Docker container:
```sh
docker compose run --rm server pytest -W ignore
```
These tests cover backend models, API endpoints, and core logic. Before submitting changes, verify that all tests pass and consider adding new tests for any new features or bug fixes.

Execute client-side Angular unit tests:
```sh
docker compose run --rm client npm run test:ci
```
Automated tests validate UI components, services, and client logic. In addition to running these tests, manually test the application (especially any new or modified components) on your development instance to confirm expected behavior and usability.
