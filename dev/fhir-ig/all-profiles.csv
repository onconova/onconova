","The type of stage information reported.","The kind of stage reported, e.g., a pathologic TNM stage, a Lugano lymphoma stage, or a Rai stage for leukemia. This element identifies the type of value that is reported in Observation.value and is necessary for the correct interpretation of that value. The distinction between Observation.code and Observation.method is important. Observation.code identifies the kind of stage being reported while Observation.method represents the staging system used to determine the code. Observation.code may imply the staging system. For example, the SNOMED CT 103420007 says the reported value is a modified Dukes stage, implying the Modified Dukes staging system (SNOMED CT 385359000) was used to determine the stage. When the staging system is implied by Observation.code, Observation.method is not required. However, when Observation.code does not imply a staging system (for example, if the code is SNOMED CT 385388004 Lymphoma stage), then the staging system must be specified in Observation.method. The value (Observation.valueCodeableConcept) may also imply certain things about the kind of stage being reported. For example, the value cN0 implies the value is a clinical stage. However, even if the value is partly or wholly self-identifying, it is not a reliable indicator of the type of stage being reported or the method of staging. Therefore, Observation.code must in all cases be reported.","*All* code-value and, if present, component.code-component.value pairs need to be taken into account to correctly understand the meaning of the observation.","Knowing what kind of observation is being made is essential to understanding the observation.","","","","","","","",,"preferred","","http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/ValueSet/mcode-cancer-stage-type-vs|4.0.0","",,,,"Observation.code",1,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Extensions that cannot be ignored","May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

","The type of stage information reported.","The kind of stage reported, e.g., a pathologic TNM stage, a Lugano lymphoma stage, or a Rai stage for leukemia. This element identifies the type of value that is reported in Observation.value and is necessary for the correct interpretation of that value. The distinction between Observation.code and Observation.method is important. Observation.code identifies the kind of stage being reported while Observation.method represents the staging system used to determine the code. Observation.code may imply the staging system. For example, the SNOMED CT 103420007 says the reported value is a modified Dukes stage, implying the Modified Dukes staging system (SNOMED CT 385359000) was used to determine the stage. When the staging system is implied by Observation.code, Observation.method is not required. However, when Observation.code does not imply a staging system (for example, if the code is SNOMED CT 385388004 Lymphoma stage), then the staging system must be specified in Observation.method. The value (Observation.valueCodeableConcept) may also imply certain things about the kind of stage being reported. For example, the value cN0 implies the value is a clinical stage. However, even if the value is partly or wholly self-identifying, it is not a reliable indicator of the type of stage being reported or the method of staging. Therefore, Observation.code must in all cases be reported.","*All* code-value and, if present, component.code-component.value pairs need to be taken into account to correctly understand the meaning of the observation.","Knowing what kind of observation is being made is essential to understanding the observation.","","","","","","","",,"preferred","","http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/ValueSet/mcode-tnm-stage-group-staging-type-vs|4.0.0","",,,,"Observation.code",1,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
