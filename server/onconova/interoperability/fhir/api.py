Welcome to the Onconova FHIR API â€” a secure, FHIR-based interface designed to facilitate the exchange, management, and 
analysis of research data related to cancer genomics, clinical records, and associated metadata. 
This API implements the FHIR operations defined in the Onconova FHIR Implementation Guide [CapabilityStatement](https://luisfabib.github.io/onconova/dev/fhir-ig/CapabilityStatement-onconova-capability-statement.html).

### Authentication
To ensure the security and integrity of cancer research data, **all API requests require proper authentication**.

A valid session token must be obtained prior to accessing any protected endpoint. This token must be included in the request header `X-Session-Token`.

The authentication and authorization flows for obtaining and managing session tokens are provided through the AllAuth authentication service. 
This includes endpoints for user login, logout, password management, and token renewal. For complete details on implementing authentication and 
managing session tokens, please refer to the [AllAuth API documentation](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/headless/openapi-specification/).

**Important:** Unauthorized requests or those missing valid authentication tokens will receive an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response.
